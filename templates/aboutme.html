        <p style="text-align: left; font-family: monospace; font-size: 18px; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">
            A little bit about me... I was born in the United States but raised in the Middle-East in Amman, Jordan. I went to King's Academy, a boarding school founded by his Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan. At King's I learned a lot of things, and developed on my interest for science, math and engineering. Growing up, I always knew that I had a passion for aerospace. I used to build remote controlled planes and drone during my free time, and fly and crash my models plenty of times. I will be graduating from Columbia University and Wesleyan University as part of a dual degree engineering program where I will receive a Bachelor's of Science degree in mechanical engineering and a Bachelor's of Arts in Physics from Wesleyan University. <br><br>&nbsp;
            In my free time, I enjoy hiking, climbing, and basically any outdoor activity. With the rise of COVID-19 pandemic, I have not been able to pursue my hobbies and my interests, thus having switched into hibernation mode (aka getting fat mode) <br><br>&nbsp;
