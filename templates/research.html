            Throughout my first bachelor’s, I have worked as a research assistant in Dr. Greg Voth’s Fluid Dynamics and Soft Condensed Matter Lab at Wesleyan University. During that time, I took on a variety of different roles and responsibilities, exploring both theoretical and experimental aspects of the motion of particles with complex shapes in fluid flows. I initially focused on investigating the trajectories of sedimenting fibers in turbulence using the direct numerical simulation (DNS) database from Johns Hopkins University. Given my interest in applied physics, my research focus morphed into an experimental study of the settling dynamics of fibers in quiescent fluid. Khayat and Cox (JFM 209:435, 1989) published analytical predictions of forces and torques acting on fibers that have been widely used; however, there had not yet been experiments validating their predicted inertial torques. Thus, for the past year and a half, I performed a set of sedimentation experiments using fore-aft symmetric and asymmetric fibers (center of mass offset from the center of drag) using small diameter glass capillary cylinders that I carefully fabricated. In addition, I designed a laser-cut tank with an adjustable wall, developed image analysis codes in Matlab, measured centers of mass to 0.3% of the length, and recorded large datasets of different fibers sedimenting under different conditions. The result was the first accurate experimental measurements of inertial torques obtained from both the rotation rates of symmetric fibers and from the equilibrium orientations of asymmetric fibers, in which we show good agreement with the theory. In November 2017, I presented a talk on this work at the American Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics meeting in Denver, CO. In July of 2019, I published my first paper on the topic as a second author in the <i>Journal of Fluid Mechanics</i> (JFM). An abstract of the publication is attached below for reference. </br>

            <b>ABSTRACT</b> <br> &nbsp;

            Experimental measurements of the force and torque on freely settling fibres are compared with predictions of the slender-body theory of Khayat & Cox (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 209, 1989, pp. 435–462). Although the flow is viscous dominated at the scale of the fibre diameter, fluid inertia is important on the scale of the fibre length, leading to inertial torques which tend to rotate symmetric fibres toward horizontal orientations. Experimentally, the torque on symmetric fibres is inferred from the measured rate of rotation of the fibres using a quasi-steady torque balance. It is shown theoretically that fibres with an asymmetric radius or mass density distribution undergo a supercritical pitch-fork bifurcation from vertical to oblique settling with increasing Archimedes number, increasing Reynolds number or decreasing asymmetry. This transition is observed in experiments with asymmetric mass density and we find good agreement with the predicted symmetry breaking transition. In these experiments, the steady orientation of the oblique settling fibres provides a means to measure the inertial torque in the absence of transient effects since it is balanced by the known gravitational torque.
